What is it: 2D representation of the world around, like a map.
	Used for navigation, localization, etc.

By definition its a 2d grid of cells containing probablilities.

Contains Occupancy gird is made up of cells and stores data representing the availability of each cell.
Can be used to answer these questions:
	1) Is the cell free from obstacles?
	2) Can the robot travel to it?
	3) Often used to deduce the best path.
Is like a pixelated map or an excel sheet trying to approximately represent a view of the world through which the mobile is meant to move.

Unfortunately it's tough due to the world being imperfect, we must use uncertainity here as well.

Assumptions:
	A place is either free or occupied 
	Grid cells are independent of each other
	The world around use doesn't change, it will be considered as static

We'll be using static state binary Bayes' filter to estimate the probability distribution for every place.

This may be extended to 3D, for a pixels like boxes representing the world. But will keep estimating the state of the world using a variable containing the probability of occupancy.
