Locomotion

Under this we'll study how different robots move in their environment like cars, drones, etc.
A need to find commands/adjust/synchronise movements and inputs given to motors/actuators/etc. to govern the movement of the robot.

Locomotion of Wheeled Robots
• Locomotion is the "power of motion from place to place"
• Relevant for state estimation
Typical drives
• Differential drive (Pioneer 2-DX)
• Car drive (Ackerman steering)
• Synchronous drive (B21)
• Mecanum wheels
